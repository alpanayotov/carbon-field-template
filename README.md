# Creating a new Carbon Field

Step-by-step guide on how to create a new Carbon Field.

## Introduction

The Carbon Fields library has many built-in fields, but you may find it necessary to define a new type of field for your specific project needs.

The following tutorial will explain how to create a custom Carbon Field.

### Step 1: Download the template

To make it as easy as possible, we have prepared a Carbon Field template, which is a WP plugin that contains a frame for the PHP Carbon Field class and the Backbone structure.

You can download the template from here: https://github.com/htmlburger/carbon-field-template

Template Structure

- `/css` - css folder
- `/images` - images folder
- `/js` - JavaScript files folder
- `/languages` - folder for .po, .mo and .pot files
- `FIELD_NAME_Field-plugin.php` - main plugin file
- `FIELD_NAME_Field.php` - Carbon Field class file

### Step 2: Name your field

Replace the FIELD_NAME placeholder in the template files with the name of your custom field. Also rename the PHP files.

**NB!** If your field name contains multiple words, for example Image Gallery, your class names should look like this:

* **PHP class:** `Image_Gallery_Field`
* **Backbone Model:** `carbon.fields.Model.Image_Gallery`
* **Backbone View:** `carbon.fields.View.Image_Gallery`

### Step 3 Customize

Here is a quick overview of some of the methods you can customize:

#### PHP

`to_json()`

You can use this method to modify the field properties that are added to the JSON object.

The JSON object is used by the Backbone Model and the Underscore template.

`template()`

Prints the main Underscore template.

`admin_enqueue_scripts()`

Used to enqueue CSS/JavaScript files.

`admin_init()`

Called for each field instance when the field is initialized. (back-end)

`init()`

Called for each field instance when the field is initialized. (back-end, front-end)

#### Backbone Model

`initialize()`

Initialize function which can be used for field data manipulations.

`validate()`

The validate method is an internal Backbone method. It will check if the field model data is valid.

#### Backbone View

`initialize()`

Initialize function for the view. It will be called when the view is first created.

Used for events hookup and DOM manipulations.

`sync()`

Syncs the user entered value with the fields Backbone model.

By default this method is fired when the input value has changed.

**NB!** If the field has more then one input, this method should be overwritten!
